# Password-Generator

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

I added comments to every line of code to to explain in detail what the code does. I also created comment sections for each function to seperate blocks of code
to be more legible to read and hopefully understand.

The issue I had in my code was trying to display the generatored password. I kept getting "object". I asked for help and they tutor and TA's were extremely helpful
but I couldn't seem to find the solution. 

Another issue I am having is when you click on the URL it doesn't show the proper generator password page I created. It shows a bare bone webpage that doesn't have styling
to it. I keep looking at my code and see there isn't any problems with it. I've been trying to work on it and can't seem to figure that out.
